# Robotic-Swarm
The Robotic Swarm Car Project involves building a group of small, autonomous cars that can work together to achieve a common goal. Each car is equipped with an Arduino microcontroller, various sensors, and a motor driver unit. The cars communicate with each other wirelessly, allowing them to coordinate their movements and actions.

The project is based on the principles of swarm robotics, which is a branch of robotics that focuses on designing systems where many simple robots work together to accomplish complex tasks. In this project, the swarm of cars can be programmed to move in formation, avoid obstacles, or follow a target.
